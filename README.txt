Project Page for Data visualization practice. 

Reasons for choosing this Project:
Both my parents are pre-diabetic and so I wanted to do some more in depth research on it. 
I have a couple friends that are also Type 1 Diabetic. 
I recently interviewed for a company that does CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) and I really liked 
their project goals and the people that I talked to who worked there.
